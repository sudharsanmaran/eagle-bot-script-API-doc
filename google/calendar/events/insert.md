2. Retrieve the primary calendar ID using the `calendarList.list` API.
3. For each event:
   - Extract event details (summary, date, start time, duration, location, attendees, etc.).
   - Format the date and time according to the API's requirements.
   - Use the primary calendar ID to create a new event using the `events.insert` API, providing the formatted event details.
