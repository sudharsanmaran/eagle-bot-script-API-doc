Remember, in these prompts, you need to specify the `calendarId` and `eventId` as required path parameters for the update request. Additionally, include the properties you want to update in the `Events` resource in the request body, such as the new start and end times, location, attendees, reminders, description, or working location properties.

## Solution Steps:
1. Authenticate and set up access to the Google Calendar API.
2. For each update prompt:
   - Retrieve the list of events from the calendar using the `events.list` API. Filter the events based on the provided event name.
   - Extract the `eventId` from the list of events that match the event name.
   - Prepare the updated event details (start time, end time, location, attendees, reminders, description, working location properties) based on the prompt.
   - Create an updated `Events` resource with the new details.
   - Use the `events.update` API, providing the `calendarId` and `eventId` as path parameters, and the updated `Events` resource in the request body to update the event.
